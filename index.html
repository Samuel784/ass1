                        <p>My interest in IT began when I was young playing Baldur's Gate 2, how it could contain so much lore and game style for a game that came out 20 years ago. The person that sparked my interest was my brother. I really have no past experience in the field of IT. To be fair the reason i choosed RMIT was a phone call with open univerity and they came to the conclusion this course would be the best course to do.The thing i would like to understand the language and confident that i can do this.
