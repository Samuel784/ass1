			<hi>Interest in IT</h1>
			<p>My interest in IT began when I was young playing Baldur's Gate 2, how it could contain so much lore and game style for a game that came out 20 years ago. The person that sparked my interest was my brother and the way work is it was the right time to skill up. I really have no past experience in the field of IT. To be fair the reason i choosed RMIT was a phone call with open univerity and they came to the conclusion this course would be the best course to do.The thing i would like to understand the language and confident that i can do this.</p>

			<p>This postition appeals to me because it supports climate change reseach, in a challaging enviroment and being in a new location in a small group. Experience is at least 5 years, 3 years working at an IT service Desk. Skills working in a small group, car licence, networking skills and hardware and software troubleshooting. The skill that i have for this role is that i currently work in a small group and enjoy the cold. What i need to do to is to get a Uni degree and get get experence in the IT service desk.</p>

			<p>The result of these tests show to im introverted and better at using an visual learning. My behaviour in a team is that I overthink and like to be organized. When forming a team i need to be more open and more flexable.</p>

			<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			<p>My project idea is an app that consiolidate all fixed term bills. Hopfully the app will notify a week before the bill is issued and a week before its due. Once issue it would tell the user the bills' cost, date and how to pay.</p>
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>The motivation for this is all most everyone has bills and get them delivered to them two different ways (post and email), some of these bill gets lost or forgotten. Hopfully this will make it easier and in one place.</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>The app would tell upcoming bills how to pay them. It should notify the user when bills are issued and when its due.The app will have a histroy of past bills by issuer of the bill and coming dates. It should have alternative companies for comparisons and a PDF of the original bill.</p>
			<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
			<p>The software needed is app language like Pyton, C and JavaScript. It would need software that connects to email or where bill info is located. App would need sercurity software and password protections. I think that app is feasible but could have some external issues with users info.</p>
			<h5>Outcome</h5>
			<p>The outcome of this app hopfully it will make billing more easier, efficient and budget friendly. The app should stop late payment fees.</p>
